# Weather Icon Demo

This is an example of how to use the OnPoint API by Weather Source to select data-appropriate weather icons.

To use this code, an environment variable named "ONPOINT_KEY" must be set to a valid OnPoint API key. To get an OnPoint API key, visit the [OnPoint API Developer Portal](https://developer.weathersource.com/#developer-account-sign-up).

This basic example does not include many best practices, like caching.

A live demo of this code is available at [https://weather-icon-demo.weathersource.com](https://weather-icon-demo.weathersource.com).
